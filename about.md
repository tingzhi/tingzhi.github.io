I received the B.S degree in Electronic and Information Science and Technology from Suzhou University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu, China, in 2013. I am currently working toward my M.S. degree advised by Dr. Bechir Hamdaoui at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Oregon State University. My research focuses on energy-aware gossip-based broadcast protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks.

In my spare time, I enjoy woodworking, playing tennis, and cooking.
