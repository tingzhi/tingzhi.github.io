"There's no such thing as a perfect piece of writing. Just as there's no such thing as perfect depair." So said a writer I bumped into back when I was a university student. It wasn't until much later that I could grasp his full meaning, but I still found consolation in his words -- that there's no such thing as perfect writing.

    All the same, I despaired whenever I sat down to write.The scope of what I could handle was just too limited.
